# Whole Village
### Turing Mod 4 Capstone Projectâ€“Front End

## Abstract

An application to help parents stay organized and connected to other parents on upcoming events associated with a particular child, because sometimes it's hard keeping up with all of the emails and group texts! This application was built in a team, which included Turing back-end students and front-end students. Through coordination with the back-end team, a graphQL server was developed specifically for this application. The front-end team built the application using Apollo Client, React, React Hooks, and React Router. Continuous integration was employed using CircleCI and E2E testing was developed using Cypress.
